# Vision for a Canvassing Tool for the Green Party of Ontario

## Customized tools for Green Party in the Canadian political context

There are a few generic tools for canvasing and calling but we would need to adapt the Green Party's process to the tools, which would mean a large amount of re-training of staff and volunteers across the country.

## Impace outside the Green Party of Ontario

### In the Green Party

The Green Party of Canada, BC, NB, and PEI are all looking to replace GVote. If we build a tool that addresses the concerns of GVote it could become the de facto tool across the Green Party in Canada. The UK, Australia, and many other regions are also in a similar position.

### Outside the Green Party

Municipal candidates don't have access to tools like this. Providing an open source tool would allow municipal candidates to use tools similar to the GPO's tooling, allowing our volunteers to jump seamlessly into municipal campaigns.

## Engagement of a volunteer base

Opening up new ways to volunteer grows our volunteer base. Volunteers who have skills in software, design and product management can have a massive impact by volunteering those skills.

## Existing Tools are cost prohibitive

There are great CRMs at a reasonable price point.
There are great social media tools at a reasonable price point.
There are no great canvasing tools at reasonable price points.
Some quotes we're received have been in the high 100's of thousands per year which is outsite our budget.

## This is a hail marry

We're unsure if this will be adopted by the GPO.
The GPO is still completing a needs analysis and continues to evaluate possible vendors.
But we had a volunteer who was ready to work on this project and even if it didn't end up getting used.
